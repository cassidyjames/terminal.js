# terminal.js
DOM-driven fake terminal output plugin

This is a project I wrote for System76 (used at [system76.com/laptops/galago](https://system76.com/laptops/galago) and [system76.com/servers](https://system76.com/servers)). Basically you set up all the fake Terminal output in the DOM and use data attributes to control the speed of each line.
